This program was specifically difficult for me to complete, as I have difficulty with actually implementing and using pointers correctly. I understand the job of pointers and what they do but actually using them correctly still is difficult. As for the process of doing this project, I started with codig option 1 as it seemed the easiest and was the basis of the other functions. All went fairly well for this part except for the fact that once I seperated the file into a char array, i couldnt figure out how to change the array to single characters for each word so I could make them into lower case and see how many characters in each word. To be honest I never really got to option 2 as I ran out of time and needed to submit it on time. Option 3 I coded after option 1, and it was fairly similar to option one except that it dealt with numbers and not string. My problem here was related to my problem in option 1. Since i couldnt parse each string into single characters, I would have no way of figuring out the correct letter to build the answer. "Bugs" that still remain are as follow: option 1 doesnt really return anything so its unusable to the other functions essentially, option 2 just wasnt done, and option 3 has no way to check if option 1 was already called (related to the problem of option 1) so doesnt know if it needs to be called.
